Let us assume that at the surface, $z^* = h^*(x^*,t^*)$, the sheer stress between the air and the glacier is negligible, and that the scaling will sufficiently account for the atmospheric pressure for the whole system. Then $\dif{\boldsymbol{F}} = \boldsymbol{T} \cdot \boldsymbol{\hat{n}} \dif{\sigma} = 0 \Rightarrow \tau_{xx}\hat{n}_x + \tau_{xz}\hat{n}_z = 0 $, and assuming that the surface is relatively flat, the normal vector to the surface will be, $\hat{n} = [ \hat{n}_x, \hat{n}_z] \approx  [0,1]$ which gives $ \tau_{xz} = 0 $. At the bottom, $z^* = 0$, we simplify the problem by assuming that the glacier is completely frozen all the way to the river bed, resulting in $u^* = v^* = 0$.
