At the surface, $z^* = h^*(x^*,t^*)$, the force from the atmospheric pressure is still accounted for by $\Tilde{p}^*$ and let us assume that the sheer stress between the glacier and the atmosphere is negligible. Then $\dif{\boldsymbol{F}} = \boldsymbol{T} \cdot \boldsymbol{\hat{n}} \dif{\sigma} = 0 \Rightarrow \tau_{xx}\hat{n}_x + \tau_{xz}\hat{n}_z = 0 $, and $\tau_{zz}\hat{n}_x + \tau_{zx}\hat{n}_z = 0$, and by conservation of angular momentum and incompressibility, $(\tau_{xx} - \tau_{xx})\hat{n}_x + 2\tau_{xz}\hat{n}_z = 0 $ which gives $ \tau_{xz} = 0 $. At the bottom, $z^* = 0$, we simplify the problem by assuming that the glacier is completely frozen all the way to the river bed, resulting in $u^* = v^* = 0$.
