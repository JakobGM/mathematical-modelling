# Mathematical Modelling Project
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JakobGM/mathematical-modelling.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JakobGM/mathematical-modelling)

Project in Mathematical Modelling (TMA4195) at NTNU


## Project setup

To install project dependencies, run

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

from the project repository root path.


## Development

### Code style

The [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) python code formatter is used in order to enforce a consistent style.
The test suite will fail if code does not adhere to the black style.

It is recommended to enable automatic (on-save) black formatting for your editor-of-choice. Here are some editor instructions:

* [PyCharm](https://github.com/ambv/black#pycharm).
* [Vim](https://github.com/ambv/black#vim).
